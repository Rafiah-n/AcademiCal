# AcademiCal

Project Blueprint:
The user is able to sign in with their Google account (google OAUTH pop-up). The system should automatically convert syllabus/academic calendar (.pdf, .docx, or web-based formats) into usable plaintext, and then aid the user by streamlining the process of inputting the dates and times into the software’s database/google calendar.
It should then automatically create events, on the user’s calendar, based on these syllabus events. If some events are not included on the syllabus, the user should be able to manually input assignments. Users should also be able to edit/update events. The user can preview their Google Calendar on the interface to view their created events.

Postponed features:
  - Link and attach resources involved with the event for ease of user  
  - If the user wants to change something (appearance, notification settings, date/time format or timezone) there should be a settings menu to change it, and a way to save settings upon closing the app.
  - Automatically plan and schedule studying blocks (eg. 2 weeks before the exam period, the system would create relevant events within the calendar)
